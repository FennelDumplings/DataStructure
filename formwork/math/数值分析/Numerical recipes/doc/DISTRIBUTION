          Can you redistribute Numerical Recipes in your programs?

     If you want to include Numerical Recipes routines in programs that
     are further distributed (either commercially or non-commercially)
     you can obtain permission to do so from Numerical Recipes Software.
     If the routines are bound into your program executable and are not
     separately visible to or useable by your users, there is generally
     no charge, provided that (i) advance permission is obtained, and
     (ii) a copyright notice like that in this distribution is embedded
     in your program executable.  Contact Numerical Recipes Software at
     P.O. Box 380243, Cambridge, MA 02238 (USA) [fax 617-863-1739] for
     details.  In distributing a program containing Numerical Recipes
     routines, you acknowledge acceptance of the DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
     distributed herewith, and of the fact that no business relationship
     is created between your program's users and Numerical Recipes
     Software, the authors of the Numerical Recipes books, or Cambridge
     University Press.
